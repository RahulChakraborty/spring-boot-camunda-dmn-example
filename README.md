# spring-boot-camunda-dmn-example
An example of using the Camunda DMN engine with Spring Boot.

Besides a unit test that shows how to integrate Camunda DMN engine, there is also a REST controller that exposes the validation function that uses the DMN engine. You will also find a small jMeter load test, that shows that the engine can handle at least 20.000 requests/minute.

You can get a DMN editor from Camunda to view and edit the decision rules.
